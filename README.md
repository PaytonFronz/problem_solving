# problem_solving
//User Story: A computer application needs to be able to identify if a written paragraph is written in First, Second, or Third Person

//Q:Using comments, write out 1 strategy that could be used to solve the problem.
//A:One strategy you could use would be creating a function and setting arrays for first person, second person, and third person. Then using a for loop, booleans and return statements to print whether the written application contains first, second, or third person.

//Q:Using comments, create pseudo-code to apply one of the strategies to solve the problem. 
//1. Write a function called findPerspective that takes 3 arrays as input.
//1.5 We will call one array arr1 for first person, another arr2 for second Person, and the last will be called arr3 for third Person.
//2. Before the for loop create a var called perspective
//3. Create a for loop that i at 0 and ends at arr.length
//4. Create if else statements that contain booleans for all arrays within the for loop
//5. If one of the values in array firstPerson equal true return "first person perspective"
//6. If one of the values in array secondPerson equal true return "second person perspective"
//7. If one of the values in array thirdPerson equal true return "third person perspective"
//6. If none of the arrays value equal true return null

//Q:Using comments, write a short paragraph that answers: What is the hardest part of problem-solving? 
//A: The hardest part of Pseudo coding is trying to picture the code but translating it into english rather than typing the code. The hardest part of general problem solving would be trying to transfer my thoughts and ideas into generalized and cohesive steps that are easy to follow.
